> - The component should give visual feedback for when the data is being fetched, the results are empty, or the request resulted in an error.
> - The component supports keyboard strokes (up and down arrows to browse the results, enter to open a new tab with the repository/user page).
> - The solution should also display a meaningful snippet of your ability to test the code.
